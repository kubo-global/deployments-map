This application allows users to locate schools on a map using Mapbox GL JS. Users can click on buttons or markers to view school details in a sidebar. The sidebar can be expanded or collapsed to provide more space for the map. The application is built using HTML, CSS, Typescript, Tailwind CSS, and Mapbox GL JS.
